Labs
========

You can run the labs using your own local jupyter instance (type `jupyter notebook` in the anaconda prompt which will open a notebook server, and then open each lab) or use colaboratory (a hosted jupyter service provided for free by Google).

**NOTE**: if you're using Jupyter instead of Colaboratory (instructions for Colaboratory are below), ignore the cells marked `git clone...` and `os.chdir`, since you'll already have the dependencies and the correct path to run the labs, but _don't_ skip those if you're using Colaboratory. 


## Running cells 

+ To run a cell in Jupyter, press Shift+Enter. 
+ To run a cell in colaboratory, press Shift+Enter or the play button. 
    * When you first run a cell in a new colaboratory notebook you'll see two prompts asking about permissions to run GitHub links and resetting all run times; accept both and continue!

## Colaboratory Links

You'll need to have a Google/gmail account to run the following labs on Colaboratory. Please use the links below to run the labs, and replace the empty username string with the name of the character you created when you ran `python launcher.py` in the earlier instructions:
