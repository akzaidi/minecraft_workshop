Labs
========

You can run the labs using your own local jupyter instance (type `jupyter notebook` in the anaconda prompt which will open a notebook server, and then open each lab) or use colaboratory (a hosted jupyter service provided for free by Google).

**NOTE**: if you're using Jupyter, ignore the cells marked `git clone...` and `os.chdir`, since you'll already have the dependencies and the correct path to run the labs, but don't skip those if you're using Colaboratory.


## Colaboratory Links

You'll need to have a Google/gmail account to run the following labs on Colaboratory. Please replace the empty username string with the name of the character you created when you ran `python launcher.py` in the earlier instructions, and change the runtime to Python 2.
